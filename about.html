	<h1>What is Mini Globetrotters?</h1>
  <p>Mini Globetrotters is a student-led community service club dedicated to spreading multiculturalism to elementary schools in the Lehigh Valley. The club was started in the 2004-2005 school year by Mrs. CÃ©cile McKernan. The program started at Calypso Elementary School, and has since been held annually at James Buchanan Elementary School. In the Spring of 2015, it was brought to Marvine Elementary School for the first time. Since its inception ten years ago, Mini Globetrotters has served hundreds of elementary school students and contributed over 500 hours of community service.
  </p>
  <p>The program is intended to make up for a lack of available after-school opportunities to local elementary school students. All of the activities, crafts, and snacks are made possible through donations and grant funding. Each member of the club earns hours for all related activities, including attending meetings, researching and creating lesson plans, preparing arts and crafts, and baking. All members have the opportunity to teach independently, or in a group, about the country or culture of their choice. The student-led club allows the members to develop strong leadership and management skills, all while enriching the minds of our young community members. The program truly benefits all participants.
  </p>
  	<h2>Who is in charge of the program?</h2>
  		<p>All of the lessons plans are created and implemented by Liberty High School students who receive community service hours for their work. The club is advised by Liberty High School French teacher, Cecile McKernan.</p>
  	<h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
  		<p>The Mini Globetrotters program is <strong>free</strong> to all participants. We fund all of our activities and supplies through donations and grants.</p>
