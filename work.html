	 <p>For the 2014-2015 school year, Mini Globetrotters received the Summer of Service award hosted by Youth Service America. The two current student leaders, Georges Batoussi and Juliana Hong, devoted significant time throughout the summer to apply for the grant. In the past, Mini Globetrotters has run several summer programs at the Bethlehem Area Public Library.This year, they led an after-school program at Marvine Elementary School, covering countries, such as France, Germany, Peru, and Egypt. As of early March, they have begun teaching at James Buchanan Elementary School, the first time in the club’s history that two schools have been covered in the same school year. They also recently taught a Boy Scout troop about France and the french language which allowed them to earn their Diversity Badge.

  <p>Mini Globetrotters is a growing club that would love new, devoted members. It is truly a fun, beneficial way for students to earn community service hours. It allows both the high school and elementary school students to learn about worldwide cultures, something that is becoming increasingly important in modern society, yet truly lacking from today’s education. This club provides a venue for Liberty students to demonstrate leadership and gain hands-on experience, which are invaluable experiences for college essays, interviews, and future endeavors. Mini Globetrotters is currently looking for donors to provide support, so please reach out if you are willing to donate snacks or materials to allow this program to continue. If you are interested in a fun way to earn community service hours, please stop by Room 227 and talk to Mrs. McKernan. Mini Globetrotters would love to have you!</p>
