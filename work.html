	 <p>For the 2014-2015 school year, Mini Globetrotters received the Summer of Service award hosted by Youth Service America. The two current student leaders, Georges Batoussi and Juliana Hong, devoted significant time throughout the summer to apply for the grant. In the past, Mini Globetrotters has run several summer programs at the Bethlehem Area Public Library.This year, they led an after-school program at Marvine Elementary School, covering countries, such as France, Germany, Peru, and Egypt. As of early March, they have begun teaching at James Buchanan Elementary School, the first time in the clubâ€™s history that two schools have been covered in the same school year. They also recently taught a Boy Scout troop about France and the french language which allowed them to earn their Diversity Badge.
