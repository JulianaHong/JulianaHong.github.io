	<p>Mini Globetrotters is a growing club that would love new, devoted members. It is truly a fun, beneficial way for students to earn community service hours. It allows both the high school and elementary school students to learn about worldwide cultures, something that is becoming increasingly important in modern society, yet truly lacking from todayâ€™s education. This club provides a venue for Liberty students to demonstrate leadership and gain hands-on experience, which are invaluable experiences for college essays, interviews, and future endeavors. Mini Globetrotters is currently looking for donors to provide support, so please reach out if you are willing to donate snacks or materials to allow this program to continue. If you are interested in a fun way to earn community service hours, please stop by Room 227 and talk to Mrs. McKernan. Mini Globetrotters would love to have you!</p>
